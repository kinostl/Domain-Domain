## Known Bugs

- Drawing >5 doesn't show correctly.
- Countered Blue is still Watering
- Opponent won't take their turn on a second match
- Something about green shields makes them act oddly? I might have my clears setup oddly.
- Need to reset shields after match?
- Countered Yellow still makes a shield. Sometimes.

## Todo

- Find a way to display opponents's shields and braces


## Blockers

- `reset_fields_after_match.md` can't continue until the forest are changed into shields and the plains have their shields updated.
