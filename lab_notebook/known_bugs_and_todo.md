## Known Bugs

- Drawing >5 doesn't show correctly.
- Countered Blue is still Watering
- Opponent won't take their turn on a second match
- Something about green shields makes them act oddly? I might have my clears setup oddly.
- Need to reset shields after match?
- Countered Yellow still makes a shield. Sometimes.

## Todo

- Find a way to display opponents's shields and braces
    - For normal gameplay
    - For cheating
    - Idea: Maybe have some dots in a spot that light up to equal the number of shields in effect? That way the cheat mode can just show the exact isntead of the count.

## Thoughts

- White and Purple should have the focus on the Bloom Win, they have the tools for it
- Green and Red should have the focus on the Garden Win, they have the tools for it
- Blue has no plan for winning
