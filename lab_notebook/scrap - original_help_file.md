Your goal is to play 5 of any one color, or to play at least 1 of each color. You win if you start your turn with the board in this state. The same applies to your opponent.

You play one color each turn. Your opponent does the same. Your opponent has the same goal and abilities.

When you play a card, an effect will happen.
