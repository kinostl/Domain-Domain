When you draw an Island, the game skips your turn.

Cause was stopping at {2,9} before calling the scripts. Removing that fixed it. Maybe it was due to how many triggers are next to each other?

Fix above did not work. Now entering via Swamp skips the turn instead.


New Theory: This happens when the player moves into the opponent trigger at an angle instead of from the player's side of the field. Teleports will probably fix this. I'm guessing the diagonal counts as multiple movements.
